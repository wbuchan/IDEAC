# IDEAC

 This 10-week project aimed to decrease the execution time of the IDEAC temperature forecasting model by implementing parallelization with Apache Spark. The IDEAC projectâ€™s goal is to provide more reliable temperature and humidity forecasts to be used by farmers to consistently predict and respond to damaging weather events. Individual forecasters often provide inaccurate predictions, but by combining forecasts from multiple providers, IDEAC has been able to decrease the error in temperature and humidity forecasting. The purpose of migrating the existing model to introduce parallelization to better leverage cluster computing and decrease execution time while still maintaining maximum accuracy of predictions ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49824508/112873220-34b8d080-9076-11eb-80eb-29febf453cd6.png)
